            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 yellow onionm, finely diced</li>
            <li>0.75 lb ground beef</li>
            <li>0.75 lb ground Italian sausage</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>0.5 cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>40 oz. marinara sauce</li>
            <li>1 tbsp tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>

        <h4>Lasagna Noodles/Cheese Toppings</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>12 lasagna noodles + extra in case of breakage</li>
            <li>2.5 cups mozzarella cheese</li>         
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <h4>Prep Work</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Combine the cheese filling ingredients</strong> in a medium bowl and set aside. Measure out remaining ingredients.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>Make the Meat Sauce</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Heat olive oil</strong> over medium heat and <strong>add the diced onions</strong>>. Let them soften for 10 minutes. (This allows them to release a little sugar which is a nice offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.)</li>
            <li><strong>Add the ground beef and sausage</strong> and increase heat to medium-high. Use a spatula to break up the meat so that it’s very fine and crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. <strong>Add garlic</strong> 
                during the last minute. Drain excess grease.</li>
            <li><strong>Add the chicken broth</strong>> and use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom and sides of the pot. <strong>Add the marinara sauce, tomato paste, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce</strong>. 
                Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover partially and let the sauce simmer gently while you boil the pasta noodles.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>Preheat Oven and Cook the Lasagna Noodles</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to <strong>375 degrees</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Begin boiling a large pot of salted pasta water</strong> for the lasagna noodles. Once a rapid boil is reached, <strong>cook the noodles to al dente</strong> according to package instructions. 
                (Set a timer to ensure you don’t overcook them.) Gently stir with a wooden spoon throughout cooking to prevent the noodles from sticking. <strong>Drain and rinse with cold water</strong> until noodles are completely cool.</li>
            <li>Lay the cooled noodles flat on wax or parchment paper while you begin assembling the lasagna.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>Assemble</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Spread 1 heaping cup of meat sauce</strong> on the bottom of a 9 x 13-inch casserole dish. Next, <strong>add 4 lasagna noodles</strong>, overlapping them if needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture</strong> over the noodles, followed by about <strong>1 ½ cups of meat sauce.</strong></li>
            <li>Top with <strong>4 more lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture, 1 ½ cups meat sauce.</strong></li>
            <li>Finish with <strong>4 more lasagna noodles, the rest of the ricotta mixture, and the rest of the meat sauce.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Top with 2 ½ cups of Mozzarella cheese.</strong></li>
            <li>Spray foil with nonstick cooking spray and place it spray-side-down on top of the baking dish to prevent the cheese from sticking to it.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>Bake</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Bake for 35 minutes.</strong>Remove cover and bake for <strong>10 more minutes.</strong></li>
            <li>Remove and garnish with fresh parsley. <strong>Let it sit for 15 minutes</strong> prior to serving to allow the layers to set. Serve with garlic bread with cheese.</li>
        </ol>
