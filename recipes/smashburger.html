        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 oz 80/20 grass-fed ground beef</li>
            <li>2 slices American cheese</li>
            <li>1 yellow onion</li>
            <li>fresh dill pickles</li>
            <li>mayonnaise</li>
            <li>country dijon mustard</li>
            <li>1 squishy white bun</li>
            <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat up a dry cast iron or steel griddle to about <strong>450 degrees</strong>.</li>
            <li>Roll <strong>two 3-ounce balls of meat</strong>, forming the ball not too loose and not too tight—using gloves helps here to not transfer the warmth of your hands to the meat.</li>
            <li>Cut off the root and stem of the onion and peel. Using a mandolin carefully slice onion extremely thin, almost translucent. These cook on the patties so <strong><em>we need them to cook fast</em></strong>.</li>
            <li>When griddle is hot, wipe down with a cloth to ensure it’s bone dry.</li>
            <li><strong>Butter buns crown and heel</strong>, toast on hot griddle. Add mayo, mustard, and pickles to bottom bun.</li>
            <li>Place <strong>two balls of meat</strong> down with about 4-5 inches of space between them. Salt generously.</li>
            <li>Using the tenderizer press down, but not all the way flat, <strong>hold for 3-5 seconds</strong> to ensure good, even contact, then spread the edge of the patty, tampering down. 
                This will get you a nice juicy middle as well as lacy edges. Cover with shaved onions, as much or as little as you like. 
                <strong>Cook for about 90 seconds</strong> and you’ll start to see liquid forming and the color becoming a richer pink. Using the scraper (or turn spatula upside down), 
                carefully scrape the patty to separate from the griddle, making sure you don’t leave any sear on the griddle. Flip, ensuring onions stay under the patty, 
                and immediately add cheese. Once the cheese is partially melted— <em>about 30-45 seconds</em>— stack patties and add to bun.</li>
        </ol>
